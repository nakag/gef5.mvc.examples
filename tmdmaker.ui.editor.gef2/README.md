# Example 2
Manage multiple models.

The main point of this example is visual model.

You can create a visual model similar to draw2d with javafx.

The visual model extends the javafx.scene.* class.

I create the EntityShape extends javafx.scene.Pane class.

Very similar to [this](https://osdn.net/projects/tmdmaker/images/#id4803).

Sorry for using Japanese term in models.
